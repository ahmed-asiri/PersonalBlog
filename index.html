                <p class="brief">Since the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> first erupted in <em>China this winter</em>, hopes have lingered that the outbreak would die down with the change of seasons.</p>

                <p class="brief ">Visual <strong>artists inhabit</strong> the same world as everyone else, but they experience it quite differently. A <em>painter</em> might be enthralled by the color of a shadow cast by one building onto another, or marvel at the intricate chevron shapes of a dandelion’s leaf.

                <p class="date ">Apr 14</p>
                <p class="brief "><strong>Petra</strong>, one of the wonders of the world, is a place we couldn’t wait to visit. Like many people, we first learned about Petra from <em><strong>“Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”</strong></em> How cool would it be to find an ancient crusader guarding historical treasures, save your dad’s life, and then charge down a narrow stone gorge on horseback?! We weren’t expecting any of this to happen on our visit, but there is a romantic notion about seeing a lost building hidden deep within the desert mountains of Jordan.</p>

                <p class="date ">March 23</p>
                <p class="brief ">They say, <strong> <em>‘Habits make a person.’</em></strong> <em>Psychologists</em> tell us that habit change takes 21 days. If someone does something continuously for 21 days it will become a habit. We are about to come to the Annual Habit Change Workshop that Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) sends as His mercy every year, to help us cultivate habits of the people of Jannah.</p>
