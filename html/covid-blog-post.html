                <h2>Will Warmer Weather Slow COVID-19 Spread?</h2>
                <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic first erupted in China this winter, hopes have lingered that the outbreak would die down with the change of seasons.</p>
                <p>"A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat," U.S. President Donald Trump said at a meeting with governors in February. </p>
                <p>April came and went and the pandemic rages on. But as Northern Hemisphere summer approaches, experts are starting to see a small impact from rising temperatures and humidity.</p>
                <p>It won't stop the pandemic, they say. But it may help slow down the number of new infections. And the effects of weather may help to explain why parts of the tropics have not been hit quite as hard as temperate regions of the globe. </p>
                <h3>COVID season</h3>
                <p>COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus, a large family of respiratory viruses including some that cause common colds. Since these illnesses wax and wane with the seasons, some research has suggested COVID-19 would, too. But others found lesser
                    or no impacts from weather changes. </p>
                <p>Cold and influenza viruses spread more easily in the winter in part because the air is drier. Warmer summertime air naturally holds more moisture. Virus particles don't travel as far in the humidity.
                </p>
                <p>Some scientists forecasting the spread of the disease are starting to incorporate temperature into their models.</p>
                <p>"We see this correlation, roughly about a 2% reduction in transmission for every degree Celsius increase in temperature," said Director Christopher Murray at the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.</p>
                <p>"It's not a huge effect," he added, but at hotter temperatures, it could make a difference. </p>
                <h3>Tropical depression</h3>
                <p>Using virus transmission and weather data from more than 3,700 locations around the globe, the authors estimated how much weather affects how the virus spreads in the world's most populous cities. </p>
                <p>Heat and humidity "may partially explain the smaller sizes of outbreaks in southern Asia and Africa to date," the authors wrote.</p>
                <p>While the weather may lower the risk of transmission by around 25% during the hottest months of the year in northerly Boston, Massachusetts, a tropical city such as Lagos, Nigeria, sees more than a 40% decline from the effects of heat
                    and humidity. </p>
                <p>The virus still spreads under those conditions, however, as demonstrated by Singapore, where cases recently spiked to 700 to 800 per day.</p>
