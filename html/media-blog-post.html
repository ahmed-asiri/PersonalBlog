                <h2>What is the problem with social media?</h2>
                <p>It appears that at long last the popular sentiment seems to be boiling with enough intensity to (maybe) do something about the problem of social media.</p>
                <p>Good. It is high time.</p>
                <p>But, even if it turns out that we have reached the point where we are ready to do something, we come face to face with the reasonably difficult question of what we should do. And, in order to know what we should do, we must first have
                    a good understand of what is, in fact, the matter.</p>
                <p>I have spent a great deal of time over the past several decades endeavoring to boil down the many different issues we are facing in our contemporary environment to identify the deepest sources of trouble. My proposition is that if we can
                    address these problems in a systematic and well tailored fashion, we will have properly responded to the challenge (and have a decent chance of handing our children a world we can be proud of). On the other hand, if we fail to go to
                    the very root and merely treat the symptoms, I believe that we (and they) will be unhappy with the results.</p>
                <h3>Problem 1: Supernormal stimuli</h3>
                <p>The human organism is an evolved homeostatic system roughly adapted to a particular set of environmental characteristics. While humans are remarkably flexible and capable of both individual and group learning, we are nonetheless sitting
                    on a mammalian, primate, homo- substrate that is relatively hard-wired in its response to its environment.</p>
                <p>Supernormal stimuli (also called hypernormal stimuli) are inputs that hijack an animal’s instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose. Evolution is remarkably willing to make do with “just enough” and as a consequence, our evolved systems
                    are vulnerable to stimuli that overwhelm our evolutionary heuristics. In an important way, at a biological level, we really can’t tell what is good for us.
                </p>
                <h3>Problem 2: Replacing strong link community with weak link affinity</h3>
                <p>The second primary risk associated with social media is that they serve to change the conditions under which we form and maintain human relationships in a fashion that leads to a meaningful reduction in the number and type of “strong-community”
                    connections and a substantial shift of time and attention towards “weak-affinity” connections.</p>
                <p>In a natural environment, the primary selection criteria for relationship formation is physical proximity. Simply put, you can only form relationships with people who are within relatively easy travel distance. Therefore this is who you
                    form relationships with. Notably, while local communities will naturally tend to form shared sensibilities, the simple fact of diversity of experience and perspective will lead to significant heterogeneity of both ideas and values
                    within any physical community. Even siblings in a family will naturally develop substantially heterogenous sensibilities and experiences.</p>
                <h3>Problem 3: Training people on complicated rather than complex environments</h3>
                <p>The deep problem here has to do with a distinction between “complicated” environments and “complex” environments and how participation in these kinds of environments trains for very different adaptive capacities.
                </p>
                <p>A rich examination of complexity and complication is outside of the scope of this document, but in brief the distinction is that a complicated system is defined by a finite and bounded (unchanging) set of possible dynamic states, while
                    a complex system is defined by an infinite and unbounded (growing, evolving) set of possible dynamic states.</p>
                <h3>Problem 4: The asymmetry of Human / AI relationships</h3>
                <p>The final problem at the root of social media is a bit more challenging to grasp. Perhaps because it is the most novel in our collective experience: the intrinsic asymmmetry between human and artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p>Gary Kasparov is a much better chess player than you are. In 1996, the AI chess program Deep Blue beat him. Shortly thereafter chess AI became effectively unbeatable.</p>
