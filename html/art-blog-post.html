                <h2>How to Train Your Eyes to See like an Artist</h2>
                <p>Visual artists inhabit the same world as everyone else, but they experience it quite differently. A
                    painter might be enthralled by the color of a shadow cast by one building onto another, or marvel at
                    the intricate chevron shapes of a dandelion’s leaf. To the trained eyes of an artist, these
                    seemingly mundane sights might be as compelling as a cascading waterfall or a majestic mountain
                    peak. Importantly, they all hold the potential to inspire future creations; the chevron shapes might
                    find a place in an abstract painting, for example, while the shadow’s colors could appear as rich,
                    dark layers of paint. Artists view the world as raw material that can figure into works of art, and
                    they may notice things that others overlook. Yet, seeing like an artist is a skill that anyone can
                    develop. These simple exercises will introduce you to this unique way of looking at the world.</p>
                <p>If you were asked to name the components of the above photo, flowers, apples, and bananas would
                    likely be at the top of your list. This is because identifying and naming the things we know
                    satisfies our desire to make sense of our surroundings. When observing a scene or image, we tend to
                    glance, label, and move our eyes from one object to the next.</p>
                <p>When we see a thing that we can’t identify, however, we look at it in an entirely different way. We
                    study its color, shape, texture, and size with the same curiosity we had as children, when we
                    discovered many objects for the first time. This is how many artists strive to see—to avoid the
                    labelling that stands in the way of deeper perception. </p>
                <h3>Zoom in on color variations</h3>
                <p>Open your eyes wide as you let them roam around this image. Now, examine the cluster of similar,
                    round objects and identify as many color variations as you can. You’ll find that some of these
                    objects are predominantly red with a bit of yellow; some are yellow with stripes of red; and others
                    are various shades of orange. Notice the striking patch of light on one of the objects, and find
                    where it is repeated on other objects. Artists use such repetitions of color and value to create
                    unity and harmony in a composition, and to lead the viewer’s eye from one similar shape to another.
                </p>
                <p>Along with variations in color, look for variations in shape. Among the round objects, you’ll find
                    that some appear oblong with blunted ends, while others are curvier or have protruding linear
                    elements. Take note of the shapes that make each object unique.</p>

                <h3>Squint and join objects together</h3>
                <p>Next, change your focus and squint hard at the entire picture. Squinting minimizes color, detail, and
                    distinctions between objects, allowing a complex scene to become a simple composition of shape and
                    color. In practice, this helps a painter, for example, figure out how to depict a forest filled with
                    trees, without painting every single tree. Instead, they can paint a single mass to suggest many
                    individual things.</p>
                <p>In this case, squinting reveals that the round objects come together to form a triangular shape of
                    reds, oranges, and yellows. Long, yellow objects combine into a horizontal block behind the
                    triangle, and hovering above these is an airy arch of small, pointy, yellow and orange shapes atop a
                    fan of green. Some of the pointy shapes can be joined with a squint, while others remain firmly
                    separate.</p>
                <h3>Look for the negative space</h3>
                <p>The space around things is just as important to artists as the things themselves; they study this
                    “negative space” with great attention. Varying the size and shape of negative spaces can bring
                    interest to a relatively homogenous area of a painting; adding such space can create balance or
                    tension, or change the feeling that an artwork conveys.</p>
