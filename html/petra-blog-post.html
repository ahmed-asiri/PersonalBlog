                <h2>Seeing Petra for the First Time</h2>
                <p>Petra, one of the wonders of the world, is a place we couldn’t wait to visit. Like many people, we first learned about Petra from “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.” How cool would it be to find an ancient crusader guarding historical
                    treasures, save your dad’s life, and then charge down a narrow stone gorge on horseback?! We weren’t expecting any of this to happen on our visit, but there is a romantic notion about seeing a lost building hidden deep within the desert
                    mountains of Jordan.</p>
                <p>Petra lived up to our expectations, even without the crusader and the horseback ride. But you can meet the Bedoin people and ride a donkey. Not quite the same adventure but it can still be a lot of fun.
                </p>
                <p>The first view of the Treasury is breathtaking, even though you know what it looks like from photos that plaster the internet and guidebooks. There is something about finally seeing it with your own eyes, this ancient, carved facade quietly
                    peeking through the darkness of the Siq, that really does take your breath away.</p>
                <h3>Seeing Petra for the First Time</h3>
                <p>For our two day visit to Jordan, we hired Desert Eco Tours, a tour company that runs single and multi-day trips from Israel into Jordan and other neighboring countries. After our border crossing from Eilat in Israel to Aqaba in Jordan,
                    we meet Mohammad, our guide for Petra.</p>
                <p>From Aqaba to Petra it is a beautiful two hour drive through a hilly, desert landscape. As we approached Petra, the hills turned into rugged, craggy mountains.</p>
                <p>The entrance into Petra is in the town Wadi Musa, a great place to stay overnight when visiting Petra.The walk from the entrance of Petra to the Treasury (the iconic facade that is the highlight on a visit to Petra), is 2km long, or just
                    over one mile. If you walk fast, you can get to the Treasury in 20 minutes. If you slow down, enjoy the views, and take lots of photos, it can take at least 30 minutes.</p>
