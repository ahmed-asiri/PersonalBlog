                <h2>How to Become a Professional Reader</h2>
                <p>If you spend most of your time reading newly published books and enjoy sharing your opinion and excitedly discussing those books, then you’re the perfect candidate to be a professional reader. If you don’t know what a professional reader
                    is, it is someone who reads, reviews, and recommends books to other people, whether for libraries, bookstores, in classrooms, or online via blogging. For more information, read this post where I explain and discuss what professional
                    readers are and what they do.
                </p>
                <p>If you’re reading this, it’s likely that you’re interested in becoming a professional reader- or maybe you’re just curious. Either way, here are the steps to become a professional reader:</p>
                <h3>First, you have to have some kind of influence.</h3>
                <p>This can be through your professional job, as a bookseller, librarian, or educator, or through having a social reach online, etc. You need to have a large audience of people to influence. Think of it this way: as a professional reader,
                    your job is to help inform people about books before and as they are published, therefore, you have to have an audience to inform.</p>
                <p>Many people already have this kind of influence, but for those of you who don’t it can be a lot of work to gain an audience. Personally, I gained an audience by creating a blog and posting reviews. However, I created a blog before I learned
                    what professional reading is, so while these steps are (hopefully) helpful, I haven’t used them in order to achieve the goal of gaining an audience- at least not initially.</p>
                <p>This post is going to focus on gaining an influence as a professional reader by using a blog.</p>
                <h3>Second, you have to build a blog.</h3>
                <p>Creating and managing a blog can be a lot of work- it involves creativity, effort, time, and a whole lot of writing. You’ll need to write blog posts regularly, and by regularly, I mean nearly every week or every couple of weeks, if you
                    want to continually attract readers and build up an audience. This is especially difficult if you’re the only content creator for your blog. Teaming up with a friend or several friends is always a great idea when it comes to blogging.</p>
                <p>You can create a blog (for free!) on several different platforms, although the most common are WordPress and Blogspot. Once you’ve set up your blog, start creating content (that’s the blog posts): you can scour the internet for all kinds
                    of inspiration.</p>
                <h3>Third, reach out to your favorite publishers.</h3>
                <p>Once your blog is all set up, you can contact your favorite publishers and begin requesting advanced reader galleys. You can do this directly by emailing the publishers (you can find contact information for those in charge of publicity
                    on many publishers’ websites) and requesting specific titles. However, if you’re new to this, you might not know which titles are available as galleys and you might not be sure how to format your request. You can find this information
                    on many websites.
                </p>
                <p>I recommend using a service such as Netgalley or Edelweiss (both websites are free to join) to request titles when you’re first starting out. Personally, I primarily use Netgalley, which has catalogs from various publishers of the available
                    galleys that you can request through their system.
                </p>
                <h3>Fourth, review the galleys you receive.</h3>
                <p>If you’ve set up your blog and requested galleys from publishers (and we’re approved), now all you have to do is read them and provide honest feedback. You don’t necessarily have to write out a review, although it is recommended, as long
                    as you do provide some kind of feedback on the galley you received.</p>
                <p>If you do choose to write out a review, you can be as creative as you’d like. Most publishers appreciate enthusiasm and helpful critiques, but they also just value the opinion of the reader, so be sure to be honest.</p>
                <h3>Fifth, keep on reading and reviewing.</h3>
                <p>Being a professional reader isn’t an actual job when you’re a blogger, but it does take a lot of effort and persistence to continue regularly reading, reviewing, and blogging. So if this is something you enjoy, keep on doing what you’re
                    doing (and if this sounds like something you’re curious about and would like to start doing- go on and get started!).</p>
