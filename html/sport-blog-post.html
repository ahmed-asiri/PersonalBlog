                <h2>One or two hours of sports each day best for teens</h2>
                <p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Playing sports is known to have a positive impact on teenagers, and a new study suggests one to two hours of playing time each day may be optimal for young people’s well-being.
                </p>
                <p>Researchers found adolescents tended to be worse off if they played sports for only a couple of hours per week, or if they practiced close to three hours each day or more.</p>
                <p>“Overtraining has not only a well-known impact on the body, but also on the brain and therefore on emotions, thoughts and mood,” Dr. Arnaud Merglen said.</p>
                <p>“The mechanism of low activity and very high activity is probably not the same, but the results appear quite similar,” he told Reuters Health in an email.</p>
                <p>Merglen is from the Hospital for Sick Children at the University of Toronto in Ontario and led the study, which took place at the University of Lausanne’s School of Medicine in Switzerland.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children up to age 18 get at least one hour of exercise each day. But there hasn’t been much evidence on what’s best for teenagers when it comes to sports participation, according
                    to Merglen.</p>
                <p>He and his colleagues surveyed 1,245 Swiss adolescents age 16 to 20. They asked participants how much time they spent playing sports each week, among other things.</p>
                <p>The participants also filled out a short survey on their well-being. Well-being was measured on a scale from zero to 25, with scores below 13 indicating poor well-being.</p>
                <p>The researchers split young people into four groups based on their weekly sports practice: low (zero - 3.5 hours), average (3.6 - 10.5 hours), high (10.6 - 17.5 hours) and very high (more than 17.5 hours).
                </p>
                <p>About 19 percent of the 438 teens that practiced the fewest hours reported not regularly feeling cheerful, relaxed and energized. Similarly, about 18 percent of the 60 teens that practiced the most had poor well-being.</p>
